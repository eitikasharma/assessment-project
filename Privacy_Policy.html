            <p>At D'Vine Grind, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future.

            <li>Where we are required to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law; and/or,</li>
