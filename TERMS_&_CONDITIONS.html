<li> Enjoying D'Vine Grind</li>  
    <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy D'Vine Grind.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Service Options</li>
        <p>
         You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a D'Vine Grind account. Certain options are provided to you free-of-charge. The D'Vine Grind Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the D'Vine Grind Service. </p>

              
        <li>Trials</li>
        <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). D'Vine Grind may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p>

        
    </ol>
<li>Payments, cancellations, and cooling off</li> 
    <ol>
    <li>Billing</li>    
    <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from D'Vine Grind or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the D'Vine Grind Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the Cooling-off Period for the Paid Subscription for which you are receiving a Trial ends fourteen (14) days after you start the Trial. If you don’t cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial ends, you lose your right of withdrawal and authorize D'Vine Grind to automatically charge you the agreed price each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription.</li>
        <li>If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you authorize D'Vine Grind to charge you automatically each month until you cancel. You agree that the Cooling-off Period is available for fourteen (14) days after your purchase but is lost once you access the Spotify Service during that period.</li>        
    </ul>    
        <li>Renewal; Cancellation</li>  
        <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to D'Vine Grind or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through D'Vine Grind, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period and you will be downgraded to the Free Service. .</p>
